    <h3>Why to <i>Boycott</i> Israel Products</h3>
    <p>Boycotting Israeli products is a contentious topic,
        <strong>in political, ethical, and humanitarian concerns.</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://chatgpt.com/c/63619651-db26-46f2-b8e4-1dec48da671d">
        <p>The call for boycotts often stems from opposition to Israeli government policies,
            particularly regarding its treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories.
            Advocates argue that boycotting Israeli goods is a form of nonviolent resistance, aimed at pressuring Israel
            to change its policies and adhere to international law.</p>
        <p>One primary argument for boycotting <abbr title="Israel">Isr</abbr> products is to protest the occupation of
            Palestinian territories, which many view as illegal under international law.</p>
        <p>Critics of Israel's policies argue that by purchasing Israeli goods, consumers are indirectly supporting and
            legitimizing these actions. Furthermore, some point to Israel's alleged violations of human rights,
            including restrictions on freedom of movement, settlement expansion, and military operations in Gaza, as
            reasons to <cite><s>boycott</s> Israeli products.</cite></p>
